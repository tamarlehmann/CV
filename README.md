## Tamar Lehmann

I am an enthusiastic and ambitious junior full stack web developer with a background in psychology and marketing analytics.

As someone who appreciates the multi-faceted relevance of technology, I am excited by the prospect of crafting clean, tested and re-usable code that will shape the world we live in.

Having attended [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)'s intensive 12 week bootcamp, I feel I have transitioned from an interested amateur coder to a confident and competent junior developer.

I am seeking an opportunity in an environment that will consolidate my existing skills and also challenge me, where best-practices including agile, TDD and pair programming are promoted, and encourages continual learning and development.

## Skills

#### Communication
I pride myself in my communication abilities. Not shy to stand up in front of a crowd, I enjoy speaking with others, always questioning and learning as much as I can from those around me.

- Verbal Presentation Skills: I obtained an 'Outstanding Achievement' award at graduation for my presentation skills of white papers in university seminars.
- Communicating Abstract Ideas: I tutored Psychology A Level for four years, assisting students to develop effective essay writing and time-management abilities.  
- Understanding Task Requirements: In my role at intu I was often briefed over email, and asked to pull together complex statistical information with clear annotations for others to digest and present.


#### Analytical
Often described as an analytical thinker, I believe problem solving to be an intrinsic part of me. Whether it's a task to be solved or a goal that seems out of reach, I begin by defining the problem, breaking it into it's component parts, and considering the most effective route to arrive at the solution.

- Psychological Experiments: For my dissertation, I designed, built and statistically analysed a novel, computer-based study exploring the relationship between two theories of dyslexia.
- Web Marketing Analyst: My role at intu was analytics based- exploring the site's traffic and providing insight and recommended website changes as a result.
- Time-Saving Strategy: Upon entering my role at intu I became aware that the same time-consuming reports were circulated weekly. In order to divert my time to other projects I developed a number of graphical dashboards which stake-holders could 'jump into' to get a snapshot of how the different areas of the website were performing.  
- Community Projects: At university I noticed a desire within the Jewish Society for educational programmes that cater to each religious denomination. As a result, I developed a schedule which brought in a range of guest speakers and met every students needs.

#### Creative
I consider creativity to be central to success. I aim to be creative in my approach, as well as in my solution to any problem I am faced with.

- Web Design: During the 12 week MA course, I learnt Bootstrap in my spare time so I could design interfaces for the sites we were building. I put this knowledge into practice for the first time in Week 6 where we built [MakersBnB](https://github.com/dylanrhodius/MakersBnB-challenge), a basic clone of AirBnB.
- The 'WOW' Factor: During my time at IVY, I helped to organise a weekend-extravaganza for Labor Day. From table arrangements and cocktail menus to unexpected venues and themed parties, we took the most creative approach aiming to 'WOW' the guests- feedback suggests we did!
- Visually Clear and Pleasing: Whilst creating dashboards and presentations I always opt for less text and more graphics wherever possible. I believe the more engaging something is, the quicker the message can be conveyed and the more powerful it will be.
