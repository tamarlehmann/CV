I'm an enthusiastic and ambitious **full stack junior software developer** with a background in psychology and marketing analytics. As a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I'm excited by the prospect of crafting clean, tested and re-usable code and I'm committed to offering a can-do attitude, strong communication & teamwork skills, and the ability to learn new concepts quickly.

I'm seeking an opportunity in a friendly environment that will challenge me, encourages continual learning and development, and where best practices including agile, TDD and pair programming are promoted.
