## Tamar Lehmann

I am an enthusuastic and ambitious psychology grad come marketing analyst exploring the world of coding and tech. 

Having studied computing at AS Level, I revisited my interest in coding as a web marketing analyst. Exploring the site's traffic and providing insight and recommended changes as a result of these figures led me to collaborate with in-house developers daily. I soon realised I'd rather do their job than mine!

As someone who appreciates the multi-faceted relevance of technology, I am excited by the prospect of creating functional programmes that have the ability to shape the world in which we live. I am seeking an opportunity that will consolidate and further my knowledge of coding in a retail/e-commerce environment.

## Skills

#### Communication
My communication skills have strongly developed throughout my academic career and commerical experience. Not shy to stand up in front of a crowd, I also enjoy speaking to, and with others. I love listening to and questioning what others have to say - you never stop learning, and who better from than those around you! 

- Verbal Presentation Skills: I obtained an 'Outstanding Achievement' award at graduation for my presentation skills of white papers in university seminars.
- Communicating Abstract Ideas: I tutored Psychology A Level and assisted students to develop effective essay writing and time-management abilities.  
- Understanding Task Requirements: In my role at intu I was often briefed over email, and asked to pull together complex statistical information with clear annotations for others to digest and present.
- Written Abilities: I assisted a PhD student in her writing of the book 'Techniques for Coaching and Mentoring', collating theories and examples from previous editions.

#### Analytical
Often described as an analytical thinker, I believe problem solving to be an intrinsic part of me. Whether it's a task to be solved or a goal that seems out of reach, I begin by defining the problem and consider the most effective route to arrive at the solution.

- Web Marketing Analyist: My role at intu was analytics based- exploring the site's traffic and providing insight and recommended website changes as a result.
- Time-Saving Strategy: Upon entering my role at intu I became aware that the same time-consuming reports were circulated weekly. In order to divert my time to other projects I developed a number of graphical dashboards which stake-holders could 'jump into' to get a snapshot of how the different areas of the website were performing.  
- Community Projects: At university I noticed a desire within the Jewish Society for educational programmes that cater to each religious denomination. As a result, I developed a schedule which brought in a range guest speakers and catered for every students needs.

#### Creative
Creativity is often considered unimportant in the world of business, however, I consider it central to success. I aim to be creative in my approach, as well as in my solution to any problem I am faced with.

- The 'WOW' Factor: During my time at IVY, I helped to organise a weekend-eztravaganza for Labor Day. From table arrangements and cocktail menus to unexpected venues and themed parties, we took the most creative approach aiming to 'WOW' the guests- feedback suggests we did!
- Visually Clear and Pleasing: Whilst creating dashboards and presentations I always opt for less text and more graphics wherever possible. I believe the more engaging something is, the quicker the message can be conveyed and therefore the more powerful it will be.
