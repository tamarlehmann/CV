I'm an enthusiastic and ambitious **full stack junior software developer** having graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), with a background in psychology and marketing analytics. I'm excited by the prospect of crafting clean, tested and re-usable code and offer a can-do attitude, strong communication and teamwork skills and the ability to learn new concepts quickly.

I'm seeking an opportunity in a collaborative environment that will challenge me, encourages continual learning and development, and where best practices include agile, TDD and pair programming.
